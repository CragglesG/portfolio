Hi! Welcome to my brand-new portfolio and blog! In this first post, I'll discuss why I have started a portfolio and blog, what I'll be posting here, and what I've been making over the summer.

#### My Newfound Motivation

For most of the time that I've been coding, I've been slowly tipping away at some incomplete projects and losing interest to continue working on them before they're done. But, over the last month, I've discovered a new motivation to make (and complete) a few ambitious projects, some of which I've been dreaming of making for a long time. So, since I figured that I was probably going to be working on projects a lot more from now on, I thought I'd start a portfolio! I'd also been wanting a way to share what I've learnt for a while now, and this blog is my way of doing that!&#x20;

#### What Will I Write?

While I probably won't have a lot of time for writing blog posts, as I'm back to school now, I'll try to post as frequently as I can, even if I don't write much. I'll aim to post a balanced mix of updates on my projects, things that I wish I knew earlier, and perhaps a few resources to help others get started on their coding journey.

#### What I've Made, and Where My Motivation Came From

As I mentioned earlier, I found a new motivation to code this summer, and that was mostly due to [Hack Club Arcade](https://hackclub.com/arcade). Arcade was an amazing summer program that encouraged people to ship experiencable projects and share them with the public, in exchange for epic prizes. Even though the prizes were amazing, and they were definitely the original reason for my motivation, the best thing about arcade was that it introduced me to [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), a global community of teenage hackers. Hack Club is an amazing place, full of ambitious, kind people who are always sharing ideas, projects, and resources. Some of the projects that I made over the summer with Hack Club are [WebScript](), [ScriptMaker](), and [KnowledgeGraphed](https://github.com/cragglesg/knowledgegraphed). I'm especially proud of WebScript, as I've always wanted to make my own programming language, and now I have! I saw some amazing projects from other people over the summer too, such as [cOS](), [Forge](https://github.com/hackclub.forge), and [Brainet](https://github.com/Neurologism/brainet), to name just a few. I can't wait to see what amazing projects people build next.



**That's it! Thanks for reading my first blog post, hopefully I'll see you again soon ;)**
